What is this?
-------------
This is a little collection of classes and unit tests that implement some potentially useful collision detection algorithms in Objective-C. At the moment the only thing implemented is the Separating-Axis Test and some supporting classes. Eventually I may also port over my implementation of the GrahamScan and a BoundingAreaHierarchy.

Why is this?
------------
This exists to allow me to experiment with
* Writing significant amounts of functionality in Objective-C
* Writing a non-trivial model in Objective-C
* Writing a CocoaTouch library
* Using Xcode to do the above
* Writing unit tests in Xcode
